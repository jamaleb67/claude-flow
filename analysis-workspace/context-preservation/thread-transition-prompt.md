**CONTEXT RESTORATION PROMPT:**

I need to continue working with Claude-Flow v2.0.0-alpha.60 that we just successfully initialized. Please restore the following context:

**SYSTEM STATUS:**
- **Location**: `C:\Users\jamal\modelcontextprotocol\claude-flow`
- **Version**: v2.0.0-alpha.60 (Enterprise-grade AI orchestration platform)
- **Status**: Successfully initialized and running
- **Claude Code**: Active in bypass permissions mode

**MEMORY ENTITIES TO RESTORE:**
Please use `memory:search_nodes` to restore these entities:
- `claude-flow-system`
- `claude-flow-implementation-status` 
- `working-commands`
- `next-steps-roadmap`
- `research-framework`
- `analysis-tools`

**WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED:**
‚úÖ Successfully cloned and analyzed the claude-flow repository
‚úÖ Installed dependencies (bypassed native module issues)
‚úÖ Initialized with full SPARC environment: `node src/cli/simple-cli.js init --sparc --force`
‚úÖ Created 17 SPARC development modes and complete directory structure
‚úÖ Verified core functionality: memory system, status monitoring, SPARC commands
‚úÖ Claude Code integration active and ready

**WORKING COMMANDS:**
```bash
cd C:\Users\jamal\modelcontextprotocol\claude-flow

# System monitoring
node src/cli/simple-cli.js status
node src/cli/simple-cli.js --help

# Memory operations
node src/cli/simple-cli.js memory store 'key' 'value'
node src/cli/simple-cli.js memory query 'key'
node src/cli/simple-cli.js memory list
node src/cli/simple-cli.js memory stats

# SPARC development modes (17 available)
node src/cli/simple-cli.js sparc [mode]

# Swarm intelligence
node src/cli/simple-cli.js swarm 'objective' --strategy analysis
node src/cli/simple-cli.js hive-mind spawn 'task'
```

**NEXT ACTIONS:**
We're ready to explore and test the revolutionary AI orchestration capabilities. The system is fully operational with:
- üß† Memory system with persistent storage
- üèóÔ∏è 17 SPARC development modes
- üêù Swarm intelligence coordination
- ‚ö° Parallel processing optimization
- üîÑ Multi-agent orchestration

**REQUEST:** Please continue from where we left off, helping me explore and test the Claude-Flow capabilities, using the restored memory entities for context.

---

**INSTRUCTION:** Use this prompt in a new thread to seamlessly continue our Claude-Flow exploration and testing.

**Created:** July 17, 2025  
**Status:** Thread capacity reached - ready for transition  
**Framework:** Complete with memory preservation
